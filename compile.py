    (
        "What is PennyLane?",
        "PennyLane is a <b> software framework for differentiable quantum programming</b>, "
        "similar to TensorFlow and PyTorch for classical computation. It facilitates the "
        "training of variational quantum circuits."
    ),
    (
        "Does PennyLane work with hardware?",
        "Yes, PennyLane can be used to optimize quantum circuits running on hardware. "
        "Simply choose a hardware backend as your device. You can find all available backends "
        "in the <a href=\"plugins.html\">plugins</a> section."
    ),
    (
         "Can I use PennyLane with PyTorch/TensorFlow?",
         "Yes, PennyLane integrates with PyTorch and TensorFlow. More information can be found "
         "in the <a href=\"https://pennylane.readthedocs.io\">documentation</a>."
    ),
    (
        "What distinguishes PennyLane from other quantum programming languages?",
        "While offering a lot of the functionality of standard quantum programming languages, "
        "PennyLane is built around the idea of <b> training quantum circuits using automatic "
        "differentiation</b>. This is especially important in applications such as quantum "
        "machine learning, quantum chemistry, and quantum optimization."
    ),
    (
        "What is quantum machine learning?",
        "Quantum machine learning investigates the <b>consequences of using quantum computers "
        "for machine learning</b>, by extending the pool of hardware for machine learning by "
        "an entirely new type of computing deviceâ€”the quantum computer.<br><br>"
        "One can understand these devices as a form of special-purpose hardware like Application-Specific "
        "Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), as they are limited in "
        "the number and type of operations that can be executed in a single run. However, information processing "
        "with quantum computers relies on substantially different laws of physics compared to ASICs and FPGAs. <br><br>"
        "In modern quantum machine learning, near-term quantum devices are used and trained like neural networks, "
        "using <b>variational quantum circuits</b>. "
        "More information can be found in our <a href=\"https://pennylane.ai/qml/whatisqml.html\">What is QML?</a> "
        "page."
    ),
    (
        "What are variational circuits?",
        "Variational quantum circuits, also called parametrized quantum circuits, are "
        "<b>quantum algorithms that depend on tunable parameters</b>. <br><br>"
        "For example consider a quantum algorithm where one operation rotates a qubit by a "
        "certain angle kept as a free parameter. The result of the quantum computation now "
        "depends on the chosen angle. Using a classical co-processor, the angle, and thereby "
        "the quantum circuit, can be <b>optimized for a given task</b>. <br><br>"
        "The principle of variational circuits is very similar to neural networks, which is "
        "why they play an important role in quantum machine learning.<br><br>"
        "Visit our <a href=\"https://pennylane.ai/qml/glossary.html\">QML glossary</a> for more information "
        "on the key concepts underpinning quantum machine learning."
    ),
    (
        "How does PennyLane evaluate gradients of quantum circuits?",
        "Wherever possible, <b>PennyLane uses parameter-shift rules</b> to extract gradients of "
        "quantum circuits. These rules prescribe how to estimate a gradient by running a circuit "
        "twice or more times with deliberately shifted parameters. <br><br> In situations where "
        "no parameter-shift rule can be applied, PennyLane uses the finite-difference rule to "
        "approximate a gradient. <br><br> Both options work whether you run your code on simulators or "
        "an actual quantum device.<br><br>"

        "on the key concepts underpinning quantum machine learning."

        "Is PennyLane open source?",
        "Yes, PennyLane is open source software developed under the Apache 2.0 License."
